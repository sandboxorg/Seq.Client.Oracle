## How to install

### 1. Setup (as `SYS`)

Following instructions are related to [Setup.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Setup.sql) file.

Before installing (and customising) Oracle package, some commands need to be run as `SYS`. Specifically, `SYS` needs to allow remote HTTP calls to Seq instance for a given Oracle user.

[Setup.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Setup.sql) file contains these parameters:

| Parameter name | Default value | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ORACLE_USER`  |               | Oracle user who needs to send log events to Seq (UPPERCASE). |
| `SEQ_HOST`     |               | Host name on which Seq is listening to.                      |
| `SEQ_PORT`     | 5341          | Port number on which Seq is listening to.                    |

`ORACLE_USER` can be set to `SYS` if you want to share package globally. If so, please remove grants at the beginning of the script and do not skip step 3, which must also be run as `SYS` user.

Before going to step 2, please make sure that there are no networking or security issues blocking HTTP calls from Oracle machine to Seq machine. Using `curl` from Oracle machine, you can easily verify the connectivity with this command (please replace placeholders with proper values):

```shell
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://{SEQ_HOST}:{SEQ_PORT}/api/
```

Result should be similar to the one described in [this Seq documentation page](https://docs.getseq.net/docs/using-the-http-api):

```

### 2. Package deploy

Following instructions are related to [Package.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Package.sql) file.

[Package.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Package.sql) file contains these parameters:

| Parameter name        | Default value | Meaning                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ORACLE_USER`         |               | Oracle user for whom package should be created (UPPERCASE).       |
| `ORACLE_PACKAGE`      | seq_log       | Oracle package name for Seq client.                               |
| `SEQ_HOST`            |               | Host name on which Seq is listening to.                           |
| `SEQ_PORT`            | 5341          | Port number on which Seq is listening to.                         |
| `SEQ_DEFAULT_API_KEY` |               | **Default** API KEY which will be used to send log events to Seq. |

`ORACLE_USER` can be set to `SYS` if you want to share package globally. If so, do not skip step 3, which must also be run as `SYS` user.

After having installed that package, you can test that everything is working properly by running this command (please replace placeholders with proper values):

```sql
begin
  {ORACLE_USER}.{ORACLE_PACKAGE}.self_test();
end;
```

If test runs OK, then you should find two messages per log level inside your Seq instance, all related to the API KEY specified during package installation; one message is simple, while the other one uses event properties.

Events sent through Oracle package will use API KEY specified in `SEQ_DEFAULT_API_KEY` parameter. If some events should use a different API KEY, following procedure can be used (please replace placeholders with proper values):

```sql
begin
  {ORACLE_USER}.{ORACLE_PACKAGE}.set_api_key('{NEW_API_KEY}');
  -- Use log procedures here...
end;
```

To share a given set of properties among log events, you can set (or unset) a context using `set_context` procedure:

```sql
begin
  {ORACLE_USER}.{ORACLE_PACKAGE}.set_context({EVENT_PROPS});
  -- Use log procedures here...
  {ORACLE_USER}.{ORACLE_PACKAGE}.set_context(null);
end;
```

### 3. Public synonym (as `SYS`, optional)

Following instructions are related to [Synonym.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Synonym.sql) file.

If you installed Oracle package as `SYS`, then you might want to create a public synonym so that consumers can use it as if it was a system package, without specifying user prefix on each call. This step basically creates a synonym and adds execute grant to a chosen user (not `SYS`, of course).

[Synonym.sql](https://github.com/finsaspa/Seq.Client.Oracle/blob/master/src/Synonym.sql) file contains these parameters:

| Parameter name   | Default value | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ORACLE_USER`    |               | Oracle user, not SYS, from whom package should be used (UPPERCASE). |
| `ORACLE_PACKAGE` | seq_log       | Oracle package name for Seq client.                                 |
